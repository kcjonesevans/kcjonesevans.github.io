This coming week is my last week of work at my current job. I am leaving behind a work wife and many many friends, but most importantly I'm leaving a job that took me nowhere. 

I'm pretty excited about leaving, even though I'll miss my work wife and work moms a ton! I'm excited to move my career forward again, I feel this was my job to figure out what it is that I really wanted to do. The boring monotony of these past 2 years has given me a chance to really focus on me. I feel like I grew SO much. 

I've learned I really am a strong, independent women with the best husband who is the most supportive person ever. I learned I really like web development, as much as I love the solving of bug issues in older code. Web development provides me with a quick turn around and instant gratification. But first vacation time, getting some stuff done, doing some side projects before I start!
